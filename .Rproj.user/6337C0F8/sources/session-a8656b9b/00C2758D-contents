## Introduction

-   **Road traffic accidents are the top cause of non-natural** deaths for children and young adults, with around 1.2 million deaths annually [@world2023global].

-   Low and middle-income countries account for 92% fo the world's traffic fatalities [@vecino2022saving]

-   The average estimated socioeconomic cost of traffic accidents amounts to nearly 2.5% of a country’s GDP. [@wijnen2016social]

## Institutional Background

-   **Brazil ranks third in traffic accident deaths worldwide [@world2023global].**

-   In 2021, Brazil reported 31,468 road fatalities, an estimated rate of 15.7 per 100,000 people.

-   Main risk factors related to traffic accidents:

    -   Exceeding the speed limits
    -   Drivers’ lack of attention and
    -   Alcohol consumption

## Institutional Background

-   **In recent years, various traffic policies have been implemented to reduce fatalities:**
    -   Lower speed limits [@ashenfelter2004using; @ang2020should]
    -   Reduced legal blood alcohol limits [@campos2013effect]
    -   Media campaigns [@bauernschuster2022speed] and
    -   Road concessions to the private sector [@alves2020causal]

## Institutional Background {.smaller}

### National Speed Control Plan (PNCV)

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![**Figure 1:** Spatial Distribution of Speed Cameras in Brazilian Highways](images/cam_map.png)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
To reduce highway fatalities, DNIT implemented the **National Speed Control Plan (PNCV)** in 2011, installing and maintaining speed enforcement cameras (Figure 1) on federal highways.
:::
:::::

## Data

### Main data sources

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Traffic accidents:** publicly avaliable data from the Brazilian Federal Highway Police.

-   **Occurence-level data**: informations about location, date, time, weather conditions, and the number of vehicles and victims involved.
-   **Personal-level data**: informations on age, gender, and the victim's condition related to injury severity.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Traffic cameras:** provided by the National Department of Transport and Infraestructure (DNIT)

-   Contains **4,599 camera sites installed on federal highways** (including exact georeferenced information).

-   **Provides details on installations dates**, speed limits, and equipment type.
:::

## Data {.smaller}

### Descriptive Statistics

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](content/table1.jpg){fig-align="center" width="80%"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Combining theses data allows us to construct a **balanced panel in which we count the number of traffic accidents and victims around a radius** $c$ **around installed cameras.**

-   **Controls on municipality level:** population and vehicles fleet (provided by Departamento Nacional de Trânsito)

-   Quarterly data from 2010Q1 to 2018Q4

-   **2010Q1 start:** As PNCV started in 2011, using 2010 as a start point ensures we always have a pre-treatment period.

-   **2018Q4 end:** Most of the traffic cameras in Brazil were deactivated due operation contract expiration by January 2019.
:::
:::::

## Empirical Strategy

### Identification Strategy

-   **Natural experiment:** staggered roll-out of camera installations and precise accident data near traffic cameras.

-   We avoid using the canonical Two-Way Fixed Effects (TWFE) due to bias arising from presence of treatment effect heterogeneity and differential timing [@sun2021estimating; @goodman-bacon2021]

## Empirical Strategy

### Goodman-Bacon Decomposition

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![**Figure 2:** Goodman-Bacon Decomposition](content/figure2.jpg)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Estimated coefficients obtained from the canonical TWFE are likely to be biased.**

-   Figure 2 shows the variance-based weights derived from @goodman-bacon2021.

-   The graph shows that when units treated in future (past) quarters mimic the control group, most of weights are negative (positive).
:::
:::::

## Empirical Strategy

### Cohort-Specific Treatment Effects on the Treated (CATT)

-   To overcome these pitfalls we implement the estimator proposed by @sun2021estimating.

-   Under the assumptions of parallel trends and no anticipation effects, we estimate a semi-dynamic event study specification:

$$
y_{it} = \sum_{d \in \mathbb{Z}_+} \beta_{d} \mathbb{1} \{ D_{it} = d \} + \delta_i + \eta_{t} + X_{it}^{'}\alpha + u_{it},
$$

### Impact of Speed Cameras on Highway Accidents

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](content/table2.jpg){fig-align="center" width="80%"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   **Reduction of approximately 5% in the total number of accidents** following the onset of speed cameras.

-   **This represents 10,356 fewer accidents** in the post-treatment period.

-   The effect size is economically relevant given the extension of the highway network and the sample restriction (only around speed cameras).

![**Figure 3:** Dynamic Effects of Speed Cameras](content/figure3.jpg){fig-align="center" width="70%"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   **Panel A**: Outcomes of treated and control units follow a similar path before the treatment.

-   **Panel B**: The choice of the quarter immediately before onset of cameras does not threat non-anticipation effects assumption.

### Borusyak et al (2021)'s DiD Estimator

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![**Figure 4:** DID Imputation Estimation for the Effect of Speed Cameras on Total Accidents](content/figure4.jpg){fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Figure 4 shows the estimated effect of speed cameras on total accidents using the imputation estimator proposed by @borusyak2021.**

-   Results are similar to CATT estimates.

-   Taken together, these findings suggest that the estimated effects are free from parallel trends violation.

### Impact on Injuries and Fatal Victims

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](content/table3.jpg){fig-align="center" width="100%"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Our findings suggests that lowering speed in sites within highways significantly reduces injuries and deaths.

-   **Column (1):** Speed cameras seem to reduce the number of total victims by 7%.

-   **Columns (3), (5), and (7):** On average, injuries fall by 5.4%; severe injuries by 2.7%; and deaths by 0.9%.

-   **These findings underscore that the benefits of the policy extend beyond merely reducing the number of collisions.**

### Robustness Check: Alternate Radii

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](content/table4.jpg){fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   **We now test the sensitivity of our estimates by varying the radius size used to count collisions around the cameras.**

-   Results are robust to different radii.

-   **Our results suggest that the effect of speed monitoring at particular sites spill over**, enhancing highway safety even at considerable distances.

### Robustness Check: Alternate Controls

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](content/table5.jpg){fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   **We test the robustness of our estimates by experimenting alternate specifications.**

-   One concern is that cameras might respond to other unobserved shocks at the state level that varies over time.

-   We include interactions between state fixed effects with calendar quarters.

-   **Our results are robust to this alternative specification.**

### Robustness Check: Leave-One-Out Test

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![**Figure 6:** Leave-One-Out Tests](content/figure6.jpg){width="100%"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   **We conduct leave-out tests** by removing specific states and road segments from our sample.

-   This exercise aims to assess the impact of locations with varying levels of car traffic intensity.

-   **This exercise does not significantly alter the magnitude of our baseline estimates.**

### Robustness Check: Removing Bottom 20% and Top 80%

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![**Figure 7:** Dynamic Effects of Speed Cameras After Removing Bottom 20% and Top 80% Accident Segments](content/figure7.jpg){width="1000"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   We aim to assess **how the presence of more or less dangerous highway sites might influence** our main results

-   We exclude all highway segments falling within the bottom 20% and the top 80% of the pre-camera accident distribution.

-   **Our main findings remain consistent with the baseline results.**

### Effects by Contextual Characteristics

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](content/table6.jpg){fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   **Columns (1) and (2):** Speed cameras seem to be more effective in curbing accidents on single-lane roads. Single-lane roads are typically more perilous and require heightened driver vigilance.

-   **Columns (3) and (4):** The effect of speed cameras is similar between straight roads and curved roads.

-   **Column (5) and (6):** Accidents reductions are similarly effective across different camera technologies (REV and CEV).

### Effects by Contextual Characteristics

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](content/table7.jpg){fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   **Columns (1) and (2):** Cameras seem more effective in reducing accidents during daytime hours. Cameras may have different effectiveness depending on visibility conditions, traffic volume, and driver behavior.

-   **Columns (3) and (4):** Our results suggests that speed cameras are especially effective at reducing accidents during weekends.
:::
:::::

## Conclusion {.smaller}

-   Evidence of traffic policies to improve road safety are still limited.

-   We use granular data on highway accidents and leverages a traffic monitoring policy to evaluate the impacts of these road safety measures.

-   Our findings reveal that the **traffic monitoring policy effectively reduces the total number of accidents**, injuries, and fatalities around speed cameras.

-   Furthermore, the **cameras are effective in preventing accidents across different road conditions and camera technologies.**

-   The **benefits of camera installation extend to surrounding areas**, indicating that speed cameras may have a broader impact on overall road safety.
